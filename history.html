        <p><span class="highlight"><b>The history of burek:</b></span> Burek began in the Ottoman Empire and has a fascinating history that shows how food can change over time. As the empire grew, this tasty pastry spread throughout the Balkans, where different regions added their own local ingredients and styles. You can find fillings like minced meat, cheese, and vegetables, which make each version unique. In countries like Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia, burek is considered a national dish and is loved for its flaky layers and savory taste. More than just a delicious food, burek represents cultural blending and tradition, bringing people together through shared meals and family recipes that have been passed down over the years, making it an important part of Southeast European cuisine.</p>
